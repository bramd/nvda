//! Per-instance Rust state for `GeckoVBufBackend_t`.
//!
//! Each `GeckoVBufBackend_t` instance carries a `void* rustState`
//! pointer that is allocated by [`nvda_ia2_gecko_backend_create`] in
//! the C++ constructor and freed by [`nvda_ia2_gecko_backend_destroy`]
//! in the destructor. Per-Phase-5 work, fields move from C++ class
//! members into this struct as their consumers migrate to Rust.
//!
//! Currently holds:
//!
//! * `toolkit_name` — populated by `versionSpecificInit`; consumed by
//!   `fillVBuf`'s `is_chrome` check.
